## 1. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?  

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that consolidates all the essential building blocks of a computing system into a **single piece of silicon**.  
Unlike traditional designs where CPU, memory, and I/O devices exist on separate chips connected via a motherboard, an SoC brings them together into one unit, reducing power consumption, increasing performance, and shrinking the physical footprint.  

SoCs are everywhere around us:  
- 📱 Smartphones (Apple A-series, Snapdragon, MediaTek)  
- ⌚ Smartwatches and wearable devices  
- 🚗 Automotive electronics (ADAS controllers, infotainment chips)  
- 🌐 IoT devices (ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico)  

The essence of an SoC lies in **integration** — a complete digital ecosystem compressed into a single chip.

## 2. Components of a Typical SoC  

At its core, every SoC consists of a few **fundamental building blocks**:  

- 🖥️ **Central Processing Unit (CPU):**  
  The heart of the SoC. Handles instructions, executes operations, and controls data flow. In many modern SoCs, CPUs are based on RISC architectures (like ARM or RISC-V).  

- 💾 **Memory:**  
  On-chip RAM, ROM, and cache memory for fast access. Some SoCs also include external memory controllers for DRAM or Flash.  

- 🔌 **Peripherals:**  
  Interfaces that allow the SoC to talk to the outside world, such as UART, SPI, I²C, GPIO, timers, and ADC/DAC modules.  

- 🔗 **Interconnects:**  
  The "nervous system" of the SoC. This includes buses, crossbars, or NoCs (Network-on-Chip) that connect CPU, memory, and peripherals together.  

Each of these blocks is integrated and optimized to ensure the SoC operates as a **self-sufficient computing platform**.

## 3. Why BabySoC is a Simplified Model for Learning SoC Concepts  

Industry-grade SoCs are **incredibly complex** — billions of transistors, multiple cores, GPUs, accelerators, high-speed memory controllers, and advanced security features. Designing and understanding them directly is overwhelming for beginners.  

🍼 **BabySoC** is an educational SoC designed to simplify this learning curve.  
It includes only a few carefully chosen blocks:  

- **RVMYTH RISC-V core** – a compact open-source CPU core  
- **PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)** – generates stable and accurate clocks  
- **10-bit DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)** – demonstrates how digital signals can be converted into analog voltages  

By limiting the complexity, BabySoC allows learners to:  
- Focus on the **core principles** of integration  
- Understand how different blocks interact inside a chip  
- Gain confidence before advancing to full-scale RTL or physical design  

In short, BabySoC acts as a **stepping stone** between theoretical SoC concepts and practical chip design.

## 4. Role of Functional Modelling Before RTL and Physical Design  

Chip design follows a structured flow: **Concept → Functional Model → RTL → Synthesis → Physical Design → Fabrication.**  
Among these steps, **functional modelling** plays a critical role in verifying the system’s behavior *before* time and resources are spent on RTL or silicon fabrication.  

Functional modelling allows us to:  
- 🧪 **Simulate behavior** of the SoC blocks  
- 🔍 Detect errors in design logic at an early stage  
- 📊 Visualize waveforms (using tools like GTKWave)  
- 🛠️ Test integration between CPU, memory, and peripherals  

Tools such as **Icarus Verilog** (for compiling and simulating designs) and **GTKWave** (for analyzing signal activity) are used here.  

👉 Without functional modelling, moving directly into RTL or physical design would be risky. Errors caught late in the process can result in costly chip re-spins.
