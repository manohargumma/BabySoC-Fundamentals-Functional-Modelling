  <summary>📌 1. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?</summary>

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is a highly integrated circuit that combines all components of a computing system into a single silicon chip.  
Key aspects:  
- 🖥️ **CPU** – Central Processing Unit  
- 💾 **Memory** – RAM/ROM storage  
- 🔌 **Peripherals** – I/O devices, timers, UART, SPI, I2C  
- 🔗 **Interconnects** – Communication pathways between subsystems  

SoCs are the backbone of **modern electronics** including smartphones, IoT devices, and embedded systems.

  <summary>📌 2. Why BabySoC?</summary>

The **BabySoC** is a **simplified SoC model** designed for educational purposes:  
- 🎯 Helps beginners grasp SoC fundamentals  
- 🔄 Includes **RISC-V CPU (RVMYTH core)**  
- ⏱️ Has a **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** for clock generation  
- 🎚️ Features a **10-bit DAC** for digital-to-analog interfacing  

This makes BabySoC an excellent learning platform before diving into **full RTL & physical design**.

  <summary>📌 3. Role of Functional Modelling</summary>

Before moving into **RTL design** and **physical design**, functional modelling is used to:  
- 🧪 **Simulate behavior** of the SoC early  
- 🛠️ Identify design flaws at an early stage  
- 🔍 Verify system-level functionality  
- 📊 Visualize waveforms using **GTKWave**  

Functional modelling ensures the design is **correct and efficient** before hardware implementation.
