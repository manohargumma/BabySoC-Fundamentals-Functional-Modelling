  <summary>📌 1. What Exactly is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?</summary>

When you hear the word **SoC**, imagine fitting an entire computer into a *tiny piece of silicon*.  
Instead of having a **CPU chip, RAM chip, GPU chip, I/O controller chips** scattered across a motherboard,  
an **SoC** integrates all of this into a **single integrated circuit**.

✅ Typical components include:  
- 🖥️ **Processor (CPU/GPU/AI cores)** – the brain of the system  
- 💾 **Memory modules** – SRAM, DRAM controllers, caches  
- 🔌 **Peripherals & interfaces** – USB, UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO  
- 🔗 **Interconnect fabric** – communication buses, crossbars, NoCs  
- ⚡ **Specialized hardware** – accelerators, security engines, PLL, DAC, ADC  

📱 **Where do we see SoCs?**  
- Smartphones (Snapdragon, Apple A-series, MediaTek Dimensity)  
- IoT devices (ESP32, Raspberry Pi RP2040)  
- Automotive controllers  
- Embedded medical electronics  

👉 The beauty of an SoC lies in its **compactness, power efficiency, and cost-effectiveness**.  
It is not just a chip — it is an entire *ecosystem* in a fingernail-sized package.

  <summary>📌 2. Why Do We Use BabySoC Instead of Jumping to Real-World SoCs?</summary>

Real-world SoCs like Qualcomm Snapdragon or Apple’s M-series are **incredibly complex**.  
They involve **billions of transistors**, dozens of IP blocks, and a massive verification effort.  
Clearly, that’s not a beginner-friendly place to start.  

👉 This is where **BabySoC** comes in.  

🍼 **BabySoC** is a *scaled-down, open-source, educational SoC*.  
Its components are simple enough for a learner to understand but realistic enough to demonstrate  
how different subsystems interact inside a chip.  

🔑 BabySoC includes:  
- **RVMYTH** → a compact RISC-V CPU core 🧠  
- **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** → generates stable clocks ⏱️  
- **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** → bridges digital and analog worlds 🎚️  

📖 **Why it matters:**  
- Makes **learning approachable** without overwhelming complexity  
- Lets students **simulate & test** actual SoC behavior  
- Provides a foundation to **scale up** towards advanced SoCs  

Think of BabySoC as the **training wheels** before riding the high-speed bike of industry-grade chips. 🚲 → 🏍️

  <summary>📌 3. Role of Functional Modelling in the SoC Design Flow</summary>

In the chip design world, **design mistakes are expensive**.  
Once a chip is fabricated, you cannot just “fix” it with a patch.  
This is why **functional modelling** is a crucial step.  

🔍 **What is Functional Modelling?**  
It is the process of simulating how the SoC behaves *before* building its RTL or physical layout.  

🎯 Key goals:  
- Verify **logical correctness** of system components  
- Identify mismatches in **timing, communication, or integration**  
- Explore **different scenarios & corner cases**  
- Provide an **early visualization of waveforms** (using GTKWave)  

🛠️ **Tools Used Here:**  
- **Icarus Verilog** → for simulation (compiles and runs the design)  
- **GTKWave** → for viewing waveforms (to see how signals behave over time)  

👉 Example:  
Imagine you are designing a PLL-driven DAC system.  
Functional modelling helps check:  
- Does the PLL generate a stable clock signal?  
- Does the DAC output the correct analog voltage when given digital input?  
- Are reset/enable signals working properly?  

By catching issues here, we **save months of effort and costly fabrication errors**.

  <summary>📌 4. BabySoC in the Bigger Picture of SoC Design</summary>

Let’s place BabySoC in the overall design hierarchy:  

1. **Conceptual Understanding** → Learning SoC blocks (CPU, memory, I/O)  
2. **Functional Modelling** → Using Icarus Verilog + GTKWave for simulation  
3. **RTL Design** → Writing actual Verilog for CPU, interconnects, peripherals  
4. **Synthesis** → Converting RTL into gate-level netlist  
5. **Physical Design** → Floorplanning, placement, routing, timing closure  
6. **Fabrication** → The final silicon chip  

🍼 BabySoC sits right between **conceptual understanding** and **functional modelling**.  
It acts as a **bridge** between “theory” and “industry-scale implementation.”
